Weekly Challenges by Tim Corey
======

Every week I take a challenge from Tim Corey(you can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxdwwgIja5Q&list=PLLWMQd6PeGY1VcJGocm1wwtFCZUrh2sc9), this are my solutions.
Will keep the readme file updated with the last challenge I have finished, with start and end dates.

After a long stop I restarted the trip to do all challenges, due to this, I remade all challenges I had done previously.
