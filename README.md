======

Every week I take a challenge from Tim Corey(you can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxdwwgIja5Q&list=PLLWMQd6PeGY1VcJGocm1wwtFCZUrh2sc9), this are my solutions.
Will keep the readme file updated with the last challenge I have finished, with start and end dates.

* Challenge 1 - foreach in C# - Start: 26/01/2019 Finish: 26/01/2019 (30m)

     Took me about 30 minutes to do this challenge, although it seems fast I had problems reminding of how to access class     properties and how to initialize the list of the class instance

* Challenge 2 - Text Files in C# - Start: 26/01/2019 Finish: 29/01/2019 (2h - for part 1 alone + 2h for part 2)

     I needed to learn how WindowsForms and file IO work. Still having issues with bonus challenge part(fields in file are out of order and need to read to class based on column header). Can't find a way to fix this.
     Update: Got the reading random order part done, still need to get a way to write in the same order.
     In a momment of inspiration figured how to do the writting part. Might not be the most beattifull code, but it works

* Challenge 3 - Error Handling in C# - Start: 30/01/2019 Finish: 30/01/2019

     Seemed easier than should be, still second guessing my solution.

* Challenge 4 - RefactoringChallenge in C# - Start: 01/02/2019 Finish: 01/02/2019
     
     Had some trouble with refactoring the database connection part, its a 
     solution I'm confortable with, proabably not the best out there, always
     room to improve with more time and experience.
